Hello there,

Please check http://localhost:49221/metadata page for detailed information.
You need to call the /transaction/dropandcreatedb to initialize the db under IIS hosted sample.
The unit test initialize the db for the test cases.

I've used more time that the brief said, because MVC Web API is not the best solution, everybody knows it, and I like to create the best solution. So I went in new way.
I have created a solution with the ServiceStack and the Nhibernate Session/Call strategy.
I believe this is the most powerful combination in now days.
Easy to develop with it, seriously and 'obscenely' fast combination.
It saves the developer resources, the hardware resources in live environment, and not necessary to use hundred of third party libraries.
I can bring back the licence cost quite fast.

Hope you like my solution.

Your sincerely,

Tamas Kluber
